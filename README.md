# beta-fantasy
In 2018, fresh out of high-school I attempted to code a fully functionable rock climbing fantasy game.
At the time, nothing of this sort existed. I didn't finish as I ran into issues with my original database architecture.
But nonetheless, the experience was an extremely valuable one that taught me the need of taking foresight when beginning a project of this scale.
In addition, I learned how to interact with valuable Node.js packages â€“ express, Mongoose, Passport, and more.
