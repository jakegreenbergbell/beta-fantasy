# Beta Fantasy

Sitting in my high-school computer science class, I was struck by the fact that while fantasy football was a hugle popular and profitable buesiness,
there existed no way to play 'fantasy' for my favorite sport: rock climbing.

So I embarked on a journey to code a fully functionable rock climbing fantasy game.

At the time, nothing of this sort existed. I didn't finish as I ran into issues with my original database architecture.
But nonetheless, the experience was an extremely valuable one that taught me the need of taking foresight when beginning a project of this scale.
In addition, I learned how to interact with valuable Node.js packages â€“ express, Mongoose, Passport, and more.
